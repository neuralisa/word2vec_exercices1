15 Oct Homework

Objective:

Use Word2Vec embeddings from the Gensim library to explore word relationships. You’ll focus on finding cases where an antonym is closer to a word than its synonym and reflect on why this happens.

Instructions:
	1.	Run the Code in word2vec_examples_homework.ipynb
	•	Use the provided code to load the gensim model and then write code that can compare word distances (cosine distance) between word pairs: word 1, word2 (synonym) and word 3(antonym).
	2.	Optional: Visualize Words:
	•	Use the existing code to visualize word vectors in 2D space using PCA or another algorithm, to explore how different words are placed relative to each other. Populate the plot with related words to gain an intuition about the model.

 Deadline: 24th of October.
