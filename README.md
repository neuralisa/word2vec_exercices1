These questions are not graded but we will discuss them!

### Easy 
- **Why are there two versions of word2vec: Skip-gram and Continuous Bag of Words?** This is a theoretical question that requires understanding the conceptual differences between the two models.
- **Why do we use softmax() for normalization and not just min-max scaling?** This question asks for a theoretical explanation of softmax function usage in machine learning models.
